I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Joint Doctoral Program in Geography at San Diego State University and the University of California - Santa Barbara. I combine spatial and computational methods and thinking to research human dynamics and address social equity issues. My research interests include geospatial data ethics, community health and wellness, and education/workforce diversity.
