I’m a third-year PhD student in the Joint Doctoral Program in Geography at San Diego State University and UC Santa Barbara. My work blends spatial thinking with computational methods to explore how people move, connect, and thrive—and how data can be used more ethically and inclusively in that process. I’m passionate about geospatial data ethics, community health and wellness, and creating pathways for inclusive education and workforce development.
