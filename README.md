# Welcome!

I'm Jessica Embury, a geographer and data scientist based in San Diego. I create engaging map products and powerful geospatial tools by combining GIS technology with software development and design. 

As I work on my M.S. in GIScience at SDSU, I am working as a graduate research assistant for the AAG Encoding Geography project, which seeks to build inclusive pathways into geocomputational (geography and computer science) careers. I am also a core student member of the Center for Human Dynamics in the Mobile Age. My research interests include public health, human dynamics, and natural resource management. I particularly enjoy working with big data and incorporating software development into my GIS applications. As a self-taught web developer, I am excited to use this skill set to expand the scope and functionality of my projects.
